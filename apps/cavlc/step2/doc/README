Description

This IP implements the CAVLC parsing process in ITU-T H.264 (05/2003)

Features

- Compatible with ITU-T H.264 (05/2003), but it do not calculate nC and store TotalCoeff, 
you need to add a nC_decoder outside this core. 

- New structure for run_before decoder, the core doesn't save Runs in flip-flops and 
doesn't need the run_combine process, this feature reduces both cycle and resource. 

- this core has a simple interface 

- 9 cycles per cavlc block on average(including P frames) 

- Fully synchronous design, Fully synthesisable
